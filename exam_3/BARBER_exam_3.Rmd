## Loading and cleaning data for FacultySalaries_1995

I will breifly descibe my cleaning and loading of data here so we can move on to the figures and models tested on our data sets. 

My file path was "./data/FacultySalaries_1995.csv". I started out with messy data so I needed to clean and organize it. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
dat<-read_csv("./data/FacultySalaries_1995.csv")
cleandat<-janitor::clean_names(dat)
colnames(cleandat)<-gsub("avg_","",colnames(cleandat))
cleandat

```


Cleaning the data took me a minute. I had to organize and separate ranks into full, assoc, and assist data sets. 

```{r include=FALSE}
full<-cleandat %>% 
  select(c("fed_id","univ_name","state","tier","num_full_profs", starts_with("full")))
  
assoc<-cleandat %>% 
  select(c("fed_id","univ_name","state","tier","num_assoc_profs", starts_with("assoc")))
  
  
assist<-cleandat %>% 
  select(c("fed_id","univ_name","state","tier","num_assist_profs", starts_with("assist")))

```


 I then needed to create a column in my new data sets that shared the name "rank". Below is the code I used to complete that. 

```{r include=FALSE}
full$rank <- "full"
assoc$rank <- "assoc"
assist$rank <- "assist"

colnames(full)<-gsub("full_prof_","",colnames(full))
colnames(full)<-gsub("_full_profs","",colnames(full))
full

colnames(assoc)<-gsub("assoc_prof_","",colnames(assoc))
colnames(assoc)<-gsub("_assoc_profs","",colnames(assoc))
assoc

colnames(assist)<-gsub("assist_prof_","",colnames(assist))
colnames(assist)<-gsub("_assist_profs","",colnames(assist))
assist

finaldat<-rbind(full,assoc,assist)
```



# Fig 1 for Faculty Salaraies Data.

This figure represents the average salary for the different positions of professors in division I IIA and IIB. The dark line in the middle of the boxes represent the average salary per position and tier. 

```{r}
finaldat %>% 
  filter(!tier=="VIIB") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rank,salary,fill=rank))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~tier)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text (angle = 45))
```



# Anova model

At first you will see how I created my anova model, and then I created a table to show a tidy anova model. in the table I created below it rounded the P.Value to 0 to show its significance. 
```{r class.output="scroll-100"}
anova<-aov(salary~state+ tier+ rank, data = finaldat)
summary(anova)

```
```{r}
broom::tidy(anova) %>%
  kable()
```


# Loading and cleaning for Juniper_Oils. 

I loaded the data set, and cleaned it so we had good data to work with and create graphs and models with. 

```{r include=FALSE}
dat2<-read_csv("./data/Juniper_Oils.csv")
```



```{r include=FALSE}
cleandat2<-dat2 %>% 
  pivot_longer(c("alpha-pinene","para-cymene","alpha-terpineol","cedr-9-ene","alpha-cedrene","beta-cedrene","cis-thujopsene","alpha-himachalene","beta-chamigrene","cuparene","compound 1","alpha-chamigrene","widdrol","cedrol","beta-acorenol","alpha-acorenol","gamma-eudesmol","beta-eudesmol","alpha-eudesmol","cedr-8-en-13-ol","cedr-8-en-15-ol","compound 2","thujopsenal"),
               names_to = "chemicals", values_to = "concentration" )
```


# Graph 2 for Juniper Oils. 
This graph represents the years since burn and concentration of the chemical. 

```{r }
cleandat2 %>% 
  group_by(chemicals) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(YearsSinceBurn,concentration))+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_wrap(~chemicals,scales="free_y")
```



# Creating Jumper Oils model.

```{r include=FALSE}
model2<-glm(data = cleandat2, 
      formula = concentration~ chemicals * YearsSinceBurn)

```
```{r include=FALSE}
summary(model2)
```


I created a table with my model that filtered out the significant values I wanted with a P value below 0.05.   

```{r}
tidy(model2) %>% 
  filter(p.value<0.05)
```
